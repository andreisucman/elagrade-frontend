AI essay grading is a new trend that makes life easier for English language teachers.

Grading essays can now be done automatically, saving educators many hours of work and energy.

There are many tools for essay analysis and in this article, I explore the best options designed specifically for grading.

First, it's important to emphasize that we're talking about AI Essay Graders for teachers here.

These are the tools designed to aid you in your grading work - not help write better essays.

Therefore, many of the online essay analysis tools are irrelevant for our comparison as they're geared towards helping write better essays, not grading essays.

You might think it's the same thing, but it isn't. Here's why.

## What Is Special About An Online Essay Grader For Teachers

An essay grading tool has a few critical differences that set it apart from the tools that just help write better.

1\. First is their focus on analysis vs improvement.

The primary aim of an online essay grader is to grade, not improve the paper.

Improvement is what the student will have to do themselves after they get their feedback. Therefore, the interface should clearly display the grade instead of focusing on how to improve the paper.

2\. Second is the ability to set your grading criteria (custom rubrics)

A good online essay grader must support personal grading criteria. You should be able to tell it how you grade your papers so that it mirrors your personal grading style.

This is important when you need to assign more weight to some aspect of the writing, such as clarity or focus or maybe the student's ability to use the tenses correctly.

As a fact, tools for helping write better essays don't support this as this is out of their scope.

3\. Third is the ability to provide targeted feedback

Students and parents often expect specific feedback. If the teacher's remarks are broad and lack references they may hurt the credibility and turn into unnecessary Q&A sessions with parents.

That's why an AI essay grader for teachers should provide detailed feedback with direct references to the lines of text that it relates to.

Again, a general essay improvement tool does not have this feature.

4\. Fourth is the focus on meaning, not just structure.

Grading essays is more than just checking grammar and sentence structure. A good tool must understand the meaning and how different parts of the text relate to each other.

This involves using AI for text analysis, and more often than not is out of the scope of the general essay improvement tools.

## Identifying The Best Online Essay Grader

With these criteria in mind, let's filter out the tools that are not related to grading and compare those that are.

The following tools are great options to improve writing, but not grading essays.

They either lack the ability to set grading criteria, don't provide references to the lines of the text, or focus on the structure and word combination rather than the whole meaning of the text.

As for the grading, the options we discuss further down are specifically designed for this task and provide a better value for the teachers.

### What about the elephant in the room?

Yes you can use the ChatGPT for grading. But it requires having a premium (Plus) subscription for good results.

Otherwise the free version of ChatGPT is famous for making things up, a.k.a 'hallucinating', which can quickly turn into an embarrassing situation.

In addition ChatGPT being a versatile tool, requires some setup, fine tuning and quite a bit of manual work.

## Which Online Essay Grader Is Best?

As you can see, both Elagrade and EssayGrader support the critical requirements for grading essays.

These are:

1\. custom grading criteria,

2\. detailed feedback with line references,

3\. meaning analysis, and

4\. bulk grading

They also both offer free plans.

However, EssayGrader seems to be more restrictive when it comes to some important features.

For instance, it only offers bulk grading, and AI detection on its pro plan, as well as limits the length of the articles on the free and lite plans.

It also doesn't support handwritten text.

Elagrade, while lacking AI detection, offers grading in bulk on all of its plans, doesn't limit the length of the essays, and allows you to grade handwritten text by uploading pictures.

Lastly, Elagrade offers a complete freedom with the prepaid plan and unexpiring tokens.

Ultimately, the best decision would be to test both products and see which resonates with your needs more.
