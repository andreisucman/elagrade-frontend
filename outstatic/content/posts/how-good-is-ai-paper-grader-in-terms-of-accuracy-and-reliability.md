AI grading is becoming the new norm in education. The reason is simple - less effort, better results.

Not that long ago a teacher had to spend 5-10 minutes to grade one written assignment (typically 500 words).

Now, the AI does it within seconds.

And not only does it, but it catches every detail that often slips a tired teacher's attention on the 10th or 15th paper they read in a row.

But how reliable is grading essays with AI? Can you just hand the result to the student directly?

The answer is: "It depends". In particular, it depends on the model of the AI that you're using.

## The Best AI Paper Grader

Just like with everything, there are many models of AI out there. Some are free, most - not.

As a rule, the free versions are much less capable and prone to "hallucinations". A hallucination means that the AI makes things up. A good example is the free version of ChatGPT.

Here's an easy experiment to demonstrate it.

Ask ChatGPT something. Then follow up with the "Are you sure?" question.

Chances are that it'll start apologizing and give you an entirely different answer from the original one. That's a hallucination.

Ever had someone replying to you without paying attention and then apologizing? This is similar, but with AI.

When an AI hallucinates it may tell that you've said something you didn't. Or it may come up with a non-existing reference.

Many lawyers were caught by that in a very bad way. And teachers can get too if they use the free model of AI for grading assignments without checking the results.

Therefore, the bottom line is if you're using a free AI model for grading - check the results.

But what's the point of using the AI for grading papers if you then have to check the result anyway?

This is a valid point and that's why I don't recommend using a free version of ChatGPT for grading. It's just not good for this task.

What you should be using though, is a paid version of AI. In the case of ChatGPT, it's called ChatGPT Plus and it costs $20 a month.

But! There is a better alternative.

## The Problem With Using ChatGPT for Grading

The problem with ChatGPT Plus is that even though it's entirely capable of grading papers, it's not made for it. ChatGPT is designed for having conversations, not grading papers.

This means - you'll have to do a lot of copy-pasting and formatting.

Because each time you give it a new assignment it's likely to change something in the result. So you'll have to either tell it to modify the result or modify the result yourself, manually.

You'll also have to start a new conversation for each paper you are grading, to prevent it from referencing the previous papers from history.

As you can imagine, this can quickly become a chore for teachers with many students.

That's why a much better option for AI grading essays would be to use a service that is made for that.

A good example is Elagrade.

An Alternative To ChatGPT for AI Paper Grading

Elagrade offers several advantages over ChatGPT.

First, you can save your personal grading criteria. This means that you don't have to retype (or paste) it tens or hundreds of times in the interface.

You give your criteria once, save it, and it's used for grading your papers until you decide to change it.

Second, with Elagrade you can check many papers at the same time. Like tens and even hundreds of them.

That's not possible with ChatGPT.

There you have to upload every paper one by one and wait until each of them is finished being graded.

But before that, you also have to copy and paste the text into the interface. And then, copy and paste the result back from the interface.

This slows down the process quite a bit, especially for teachers with many students.

On the other hand, with Elagrade, you just drop all of the papers in bulk, and click "Grade".

No need to wait for each paper. No need to copy and paste the text.

The third advantage of Elagrade over ChatGPT is subtle but important.

When you copy tens of papers from ChatGPT into your Google or Word doc, there is a chance of messing up.

For example, you can copy the wrong feedback. As you can guess, this can easily translate into an embarrassing situation. Therefore, you'll have to check each text before copying and pasting. I.e. do the extra work.

And as you may have guessed, you don't have such a problem with Elagrade. When you use Elagrade, all results are readily available in a DOC file.

No need for copy-pasting. No room for errors.

## The Biggest Advantage Of Elagrade Over ChatGPT

Lastly, the biggest advantage of Elagrade over ChatGPT is price.

While ChatGPT Plus is only available as a monthly subscription, Elagrade gives you a free plan, and if you need more, you can take advantage of the pay-as-you-go model.

For context, 10 additional pages cost just 50 cents with Elagrade.

This means that if you have a class of 30 students, your total monthly grading cost will be 50 cents (20 free and 10 additional pages).

And if you have 60 students the total monthly cost will be $2.

With ChatGPT this cost is 10 times higher.

But "I might use ChatGPT for other purposes too, like coming up with lesson plans for example" you might think.

That's right, but this is something the free version of ChatGPT is perfectly capable of doing.

That's because 'hallucinations' are only a problem when grading, but they're entirely harmless (and maybe even beneficial) when you have to brainstorm new ideas.

That's why using the free version of ChatGPT for brainstorming (like coming up with lesson plans) and Elagrade for grading will give you the best of two worlds: the cheapest service - with the best quality.

Whichever setup you end up choosing AI will save you a lot of time and energy. Depending on your schedule this could mean better work-life balance or more free time for the activities you love.

Whatever the positive effect ends up being, one thing is sure. It wouldn't have been possible without the AI transformation.
