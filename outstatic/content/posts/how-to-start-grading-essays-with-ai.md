Since AI entered education English language teachers got a chance of getting a better work-life balance.

You can now outsource the most tedious task of essay grading to an essay grading software without having to waste your weekends and sick days on this mind-numbing activity you're not compensated for.

## Two Popular Ways Of Grading Essays With AI

There are 2 ways of using AI for essay scoring. The first is via general-purpose LLMs such as ChatGPT or Anthropic.

These platforms give you an intuitive interface where you can copy and paste the students' works, followed by the grading instructions you would like the model to apply.

The advantage of this method is that it's free.

Both ChatGPT and Anthropic have free versions with unlimited message quota.

The disadvantage, however, is that the free models often make mistakes because they have limited resources.

In grading essays, this translates into 'hallucinations' when the AI makes up information.

It can, for instance, say that something exists in the text when it doesn't or ignore something that is there as if it wasn't.

As you can guess, this can lead to additional Q&A sessions and calls from parents questioning the feedback and reasoning behind grading.

**That's why when using a free LLM such as the free version of ChatGPT for grading it's important to read the reasoning provided by the AI and check if it makes sense in the context of the paper.**

It also helps to ask the AI to grade the same paper several times and then combine all feedback.

This helps decrease the probability of the AI missing a point, as what is missed in one run will likely be caught in the subsequent rounds.

But as you can guess, this will easily turn into a time-consuming chore.

Not only you'll have to copy and paste the essays and instructions multiple times, but you'll have to read each feedback, combine it, and still check if everything makes sense.

That's why while it sounds attractive to use the free model at first glance, you quickly realize that you're actually paying much more with your time spent on checking the quality.

### The Best Approach To Scoring Papers With AI

That's why if you're serious about grading essays with AI, you should consider using a paid AI model or a specialized service that is based on a paid model of AI.

We've covered this in detail in [How ELA Teachers Can Embrace AI Essay Grading to Meet Educational Demands](https://elagrade.com/blog/how-ela-teachers-can-embrace-ai-essay-grading), but here's the gist:

When you upgrade to a paid plan of ChatGPT (called ChatGPT Plus), you get access to its most powerful model - the GPT 4.

Unlike the free model, it has a much stronger reasoning and almost never misses anything.

In fact, GPT 4 [surpassed humans in the USMLE soft skill assessments](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-023-43436-9) (78% vs 86.4%) meaning that you can rely on its grading not less (if not more) than you could on a human assistant for helping you with grading.

**The downsides of GPT 4, however, are its price ($20/month), limited quota of 40 messages per 3 hours, and the fact that you still have to do a lot of copy-pasting and instruction prompting.**

Therefore, an even better option, both in terms of pricing and lower effort would be to use a specialized grading software based on the same AI model as the GPT 4.

We've compared 2 such options in the [best online essay grader for English teachers](https://elagrade.com/blog/the-best-online-essay-grader-for-english-teachers), but here's the main point:

### The Advantages of A Specialized Essay Grader

A specialized essay grader (such as Elagrade) lets you save your grading criteria and upload the essays in bulk as files.

It means you don't have to open each file and copy and paste it in the chat, and then back, which decreases the manual error rate and saves you a lot of time.

And most importantly, unlike GPT 4, Elagrade gives you 20 papers free each month, and if you need more, you can opt into the prepaid plan to pay only for what you use.

This means you could use a free version of GPT for your daily tasks such as brainstorming and lesson planning, and Elagrade for grading papers without the risk of hallucinations and having to pay a $20 monthly subscription.
