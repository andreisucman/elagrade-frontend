## The Problems Of Grading Without AI

ELA teachers face an ever-increasing workload that can sometimes feel overwhelming.

Between crafting engaging lesson plans, managing classrooms, and staying current with educational trends, there's a significant challenge that often keeps us up late into the night, and results in unpaid labor on weekends, or sick days: grading essays.

It's a crucial part of our job, yet it consumes so much of our time. The demand for timely and thorough feedback is not only a pedagogical necessity but also a hard-to-refuse requirement often emphasized by parents and school administrators.

They seek tangible evidence of the kid's progress and learning outcomes, without taking into consideration the feasibility of such feedback and most importantly the compensation the teachers should be awarded for having to spend their personal time on weekends and sick days to meet those demands.

Fortunately, there's a promising solution emerging on the horizon, or rather - already emerged in the lives of many, but not all teachers - the AI essay grading.

This technological breakthrough offers a beacon of hope, promising to streamline the grading process while maintaining, if not enhancing, the quality of feedback provided.

In this article, we explore the 2 practical ways that ELA teachers can leverage AI essay grading to reclaim valuable hours and enrich their teaching practices.

## How Is AI Grading Essays

What is fascinating about AI essay grading is that the algorithm doesn’t actually understand what's written. Yet, it provides feedback that is extremely accurate and to the point - a true marvel of engineering.

At the heart of this technology is a process known as vectorization, which transforms sentences and phrases into numerical values to then mathematically compute the relationships between the numbers. The result is a pattern that enables the AI to grasp the meaning of the text without having to understand it in the traditional human sense - a concept that's nothing short of mind-blowing.

These mathematical relationships are key, as they allow the program to catch every nuance of writing, nuances that can often elude human attention or influence us, leading to potential bias in grading.

This aspect is particularly relevant for teachers who handle a large number of students and are tasked with grading dozens, if not hundreds, of written assignments and full-page essays that can really numb the mind, especially when there’s no chance of having a break due to the limited time allocated to this activity.

In these situations the efficiency brought by AI in essay grading is transformative; it not only elevates the caliber of feedback but affords us the opportunity for much-needed self-care and quality time with our families, fostering a healthier work-life balance, and boosting motivation to work in the demanding world of education.

## What AI Essay Grading Solutions Are There

There are two distinct ways in which English Language Arts essays can be graded: **using ChatGPT** or **specialized grading tools such as Elagrade**.

![chatgpt and elagrade logos](/images/chatgpt-and-elagrade-logos-g5Mj.webp)

1. When using ChatGPT you have two options - a free and a paid one. The free option while cost-effective, tends to produce inaccurate and inconsistent results. This inconsistency arises due to the free AI model that serves as the basis of the program being trained on a smaller dataset and using limited processing power that results in its poor ability to comprehend to follow instructions.

   Consequently, it often misses or misinterprets key arguments in essays, a phenomenon known as 'hallucination.' For instance, it might overlook critical points made in the text or falsely identify arguments that aren't present.

   In contrast, the paid version of ChatGPT is notably more robust. It demonstrates a solid understanding of the text, almost entirely eliminating 'hallucinations.' This is a model you can truly entrust your grading to without being worried that it can add or remove something from the paper.

   Regardless of which version of ChatGPT you're using, the process involves manually copying and pasting essays into the chat interface and then transferring the responses back.

   This method, while more efficient than grading each paper manually, is still time-consuming and prone to errors. For example, there's a risk of pasting incorrect feedback due to an accidental copy of the wrong conversation chat, requiring additional focus time and effort to ensure the accuracy of results.
2. Another popular way to grade essays with AI is by using specialized AI grading platforms, such as Elagrade.com, that offer a more streamlined alternative. These platforms allow for bulk grading of essays, eliminating the laborious task of copying and pasting assignments.

   This efficiency reduces the grading time from hours to minutes and removes the necessity of putting in extra effort for double-checking for manual errors often arising from distractions and daydreaming natural to humans. Additionally, the results are presented in a structured report that is easily downloadable with a single click as opposed to the results in ChatGPT that are scattered across multiple conversations.

   Elagrade comes with a prepaid pricing plan, charging only for the amount of grading required which makes it a more practical, error-free, and cost-effective solution compared to the paid version of ChatGPT, which is only available as a monthly subscription service.

## A Practical Instruction To Grading Essays With AI

### Grading Essays With ChatGPT Individually

To begin grading essays using ChatGPT, start by signing up at <https://chat.openai.com>

![chatgpt login screen interface](/images/1-chagpt-main-screen-I3MD.webp)

Once logged in, you'll navigate to the chat area where the actual interaction with AI takes place. If you're looking for enhanced capabilities, you'll notice the option to upgrade to the paid version in the bottom left corner of the chat. You can then select the Plus option and make a payment.

![chatgpt main screen interface](/images/2-chatgpt-main-screen-interface-g0ND.webp)

After upgrading, select the paid version from a dropdown menu at the top of the screen, ensuring that you have access to its advanced features. 

![chatgpt select model interface](/images/3-chatgpt-select-model-dropdown-interface-A3MD.webp)

To grade an essay, you'll copy and paste the text into the chat area, along with clear instructions for grading, specifying the criteria and which aspects to focus on.

If the initial result is not satisfactory, you can provide additional feedback to ChatGPT to refine its analysis. This iterative process allows for a more tailored and accurate grading but takes more time and effort. Once you're satisfied with the result, copy and paste the feedback into a separate document.

If you have multiple papers to grade, it's important to maintain consistency. Provide the exact same grading instructions for each paper to ensure uniform standards.

You should also start a separate conversation each time you grade a new paper to prevent the AI from mixing the text or feedback from a previous student's essay. To start a new conversation click the ChatGPT logo in the top left corner. This ensures that each student's work is evaluated independently and maintains the integrity of the grading process.

### Grading Essays In Bulk With Elagrade

The key advantage of Elagrade over ChatGPT is its ability to handle bulk grading and save grading criteria, which eliminates the need for repetitive typing and copy-pasting as well as the risks associated with mistakenly pasting wrong feedback.

This not only saves hours but also ensures consistency in grading style and allows you not to worry about checking whether each feedback corresponds to the person it has been given to.

Under the hood, Elagrade uses the same premium version of the AI as ChatGPT Plus, which is free from hallucinations and is capable of conducting in-depth analysis and providing detailed personalized feedback on each line graded.

To start using Elagrade create a free account at <https://elagrade.com/sign-up>

![elagrade sign up screen interface](/images/1-elagrade-signup-screen-g3ND.webp)

Then, confirm your email and you’re good to go.

Grading with Elagrade is pretty intuitive. You first give your assignment a name. Then, you upload the students' papers, which can be in various formats like photos of the hardcopies, as well as electronic PDF, DOC, or TXT documents.

Next, you add your grading criteria and then grade your papers with it.

Adding your grading criteria is crucial as it allows you to infuse your personal grading style into the AI to make grading truly yours.

Describe what earns the highest and lowest grades, along with the key elements you consider important in the student's work and any rubrics you use, if you typically give feedback by rubrics. This tailored approach ensures that the grading reflects your unique perspective and standards and is practically indiscernible from your manual grading.

![elagrade add grading criteria](/images/4-elagrade-add-grading-criteria-kwNT.webp)

Once you set your criteria, click 'Save' followed by 'Grade'. Within a few minutes, you will get a single report in docx format that includes individual grades, detailed explanations for these grades, specific feedback for each student for each rubric line-by-line, and the original text that was graded.

![elagrade grading report](/images/5-elagrade-grading-report-k0MD.webp)

Additionally, the report will show the class average and median for the assignment, allowing you to easily compare groups of students or their performance between the assignments.

## Is It Ethical To Use AI For Grading

Ever since AI started being used to grade papers, there have been debates on its ethical implications. A common viewpoint is that if students spend time writing an essay, teachers should put in the effort to read them. Even though this perspective seems sound at first glance it overlooks the fundamental difference in the objectives of writing and grading essays.

The act of writing an essay is an intellectual exercise for students, intended to develop their critical thinking and writing skills. The importance lies in the process of writing, not the essay itself. This process demands that students invest time and effort, as it is through this endeavor that they grow intellectually.

Conversely, the primary goal of grading is to provide objective and detailed feedback. In this context, the process of how the feedback is generated is less significant than the end result. The essential factor is that students receive accurate, constructive feedback that guides them in improving aspects like vocabulary and style. 

Therefore, there's no ethical dilemma in using AI for grading. The use of AI in this capacity ensures that each student receives thorough and impartial feedback, a goal that can be challenging to achieve without AI assistance.

In fact, there is actually an ethical concern in teachers not using AI for grading. This becomes obvious if you consider the increasing trend of students submitting entirely AI-generated essays that they’ve spent minimal effort on writing yet the teachers have to spend hours on grading.

Utilizing AI for grading in this scenario allows teachers to protect their time and effort from having to read papers and write feedback that the particular dishonest students are not even reading or taking into consideration.

In conclusion, the ethical question lies more in the act of students relying on AI for essay writing, while expecting teachers to grade them manually. Employing AI for grading on the other hand aligns well with the educational goals of delivering thorough and unbiased feedback, and does not, in itself, constitute an ethical dilemma.

## AI As The Pillar Of Effective Grading

Many teachers especially ELA, face a significant challenge in providing detailed, timely feedback on student essays while managing their ever-increasing workloads and maintaining a healthy work-life balance.

The advent of AI essay grading offers a promising solution to this dilemma by providing accurate, unbiased feedback, and allowing teachers to save time and reduce the risk of burnout.

With tools such as ChatGPT and specialized platforms like Elagrade.com, teachers can choose between individualized feedback or efficient bulk grading, depending on their needs.

While ethical concerns have been raised about the use of AI in grading, it is clear that the primary objective of grading - to provide constructive feedback - is met effectively by AI. Furthermore, in an era where students use AI for essay writing, it is increasingly important for teachers to leverage similar technologies to preserve the integrity and efficiency of the educational process.

Ultimately, integrating AI into essay grading not only streamlines teachers' workflows but also enhances the quality of feedback for students, aligning well with the goals of modern education.

By integrating AI into our workflow, teachers can meet the demands for comprehensive feedback and grading without the fear of falling behind the schedule, satisfying the expectations of parents and administrators, while freeing up time to maintain their sanity and health.
