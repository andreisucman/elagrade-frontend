ELA teachers face an overwhelming workload.

Between crafting lesson plans, managing classrooms, and staying current with teaching trends, there's a big challenge that keeps them up into the night: grading essays.

It's a crucial part of a teacher's job, yet it consumes so much time. The demand for timely feedback is not just a necessity but a requirement by parents and school administrators.

They seek tangible evidence of the kid's progress, without taking into consideration its feasibility and most importantly the compensation the teachers should be awarded for having to spend their time on weekends and sick days to meet those demands.

Fortunately, there's a promising solution that is already in the lives of some, but not all teachers - the AI essay grading.

This technology is a beacon of hope, promising to ease the grading process while maintaining the quality of feedback provided to students.

In this article, we explore the 2 practical ways that ELA teachers can leverage AI essay grading to reclaim their time and meet pedagogical demands.

## How Is AI Grading Essays

What is fascinating about AI is that it doesn’t understand anything. Yet, it provides feedback that is extremely accurate and to the point - a true marvel of engineering.

At the heart of this technology is a process known as vectorization, which transforms letters into numbers and then computes their relationships. The result is a pattern that enables the AI to grasp the meaning of the text without understanding it in the traditional human sense - a concept that's nothing short of mind-blowing.

These mathematical relationships allow the AI to catch every nuance of writing, nuances that can often elude human attention or influence us, leading to potential bias.

This aspect is especially relevant for teachers who have a large number of students and therefore are tasked with grading dozens, if not hundreds, of written assignments and full-page essays that can numb the mind, especially when there are no breaks due to the limited time allocated to grading.

In these situations the efficiency brought by AI is transformative; it not only eliminates bias, but also elevates the caliber of feedback and affords teachers the opportunity for much-needed self-care and quality time, fostering a work-life balance, and boosting motivation in the demanding world of education.

## What AI Essay Grading Solutions Are There

There are two distinct ways in which ELA teachers can grade essays:

**1. Using ChatGPT**

**2. Using specialized grading tools such as Elagrade**.

![chatgpt and elagrade logos](/images/chatgpt-and-elagrade-logos-E4ND.webp)

1\. When using ChatGPT you have two options - a free and a paid one. The free option while cost-effective, produces inaccurate and inconsistent results.

The reason for this is that the AI model serving as the basis of the free program is trained on a small dataset and uses limited processing power, which results in its poor ability to comprehend and follow instructions.

That's why it often misses or misinterprets information, which is called 'hallucination.' For instance, it might overlook critical points or falsely identify arguments that don't exist.

In contrast, the paid version of ChatGPT is notably more robust. It deeply understands the meaning, almost entirely eliminating 'hallucinations.' This is a model you can truly entrust your grading to without being worried that it can add or remove something from the paper.

But regardless of which version of AI you're using, grading with ChatGPT involves manually copying and pasting essays into the chat and then transferring the responses back.

This method, while more efficient than grading manually, is still time-consuming and prone to errors.

For example, there's a risk of accidentally copying the wrong feedback from the chat when grading multiple papers, which is why it requires additional focus and effort to ensure the accuracy of results.

2\. Another popular way to grade essays with AI is by using specialized grading platforms, such as elagrade.com that offer a more streamlined way of uploading papers and downloading the results. For instance, Elagrade allows for bulk grading, eliminating the task of copying and pasting assignments.

This efficiency reduces the grading time from hours to minutes and removes the risk of errors often arising from distractions and daydreaming natural to humans.

Additionally, it presents the results in a structured report that can be downloaded with a single click as opposed to ChatGPT, where the responses are scattered across multiple conversations and must be copied one by one.

Elagrade comes with a prepaid pricing plan, making it a more comfortable solution compared to the paid version of ChatGPT, which is only available as a monthly subscription.

## A Practical Instruction To Grading Essays With AI

### Grading Essays With ChatGPT

To begin grading essays with ChatGPT, start by signing up at <https://chat.openai.com>

![chatgpt login screen interface](/images/1-chagpt-main-screen-gyND.webp)

Once logged in, navigate to the chat area where the actual interaction takes place. If you wish to use the paid plan, click on the option to upgrade in the bottom left corner of the chat. Then select the Plus plan and make a payment.

![chatgpt main screen interface](/images/2-chatgpt-main-screen-interface-g2Mj.webp)

After upgrading, select the premium version of the AI called GPT4 from the dropdown menu at the top.

![chatgpt select model interface](/images/3-chatgpt-select-model-dropdown-interface-MxNz.webp)

To grade an essay, you'll copy and paste the text into the chat area, along with your instructions for grading, specifying the criteria and which aspects to focus on.

If the result is poor, you can provide additional feedback and ask to refine the analysis. This iterative process usually ends in an accurate grading but takes time and effort to implement.

Once you're satisfied with the result, copy and paste the feedback into a separate document.

If you have multiple papers to grade, it's important to maintain consistency. Provide the exact same grading instructions for each paper to ensure uniform standards for all students.

You should also start a separate conversation each time you grade a new paper to prevent the AI from mixing the text or feedback from a previous student's essay.

To start a new conversation click the ChatGPT logo in the top left corner. This ensures that each paper is evaluated independently and the AI maintains the integrity of the grading process.

### Grading Essays In Bulk With Elagrade

The key advantage of Elagrade over ChatGPT is that it handles grading in bulk. It also lets you save your grading criteria, to avoid repetitive typing, copy-pasting, and the risk of providing wrong feedback.

This not only saves hours but makes grading consistent and saves time on double-checking the copied feedback for accuracy.

Under the hood, Elagrade uses the same premium version of ChatGPT Plus, without hallucinations, capable of conducting in-depth analysis and providing detailed personalized feedback to each student.

To start using Elagrade create a free account at <https://elagrade.com/sign-up>

![elagrade sign up screen interface](/images/1-elagrade-signup-screen-U2Mz.webp)

Then, confirm your email and you’re good to go. Grading with Elagrade is pretty intuitive.

You first give your assignment a name. After that, upload the students' papers, which can be in various formats like photos of the hardcopies, and PDF, DOC, or TXT documents.

![](/images/3-elagrade-add-students-interface-UwND.webp)

Each student is represented by a box. If you have multiple pages of a hard copy just take a photo of each page and upload it in the box.

Next, you add your grading criteria and then grade your papers based on it.

Adding your grading criteria is important as it allows you to infuse your personal style to make grading personal.

Setting the criteria is easy. Write a short sentence about what earns the highest and lowest grades. Then tell what you consider important, and finally add a few rubrics that you want the AI to use for feedback.

This tailored approach makes the AI adapt your grading style making it practically indiscernible from your manual grading.

![elagrade add grading criteria](/images/4-elagrade-add-grading-criteria-IzNT.webp)

Once you've set your criteria, click 'Save' followed by 'Grade'.

Within a few minutes, you will get a report in the docx format that includes grades, detailed explanations, and specific feedback for each student according to the rubrics line-by-line.

![elagrade grading report](/images/5-elagrade-grading-report-QwOT.webp)

Additionally, the report will show the class average and median grades for the assignment, allowing you to easily compare groups of students.

## Is It Ethical To Use AI For Grading

Ever since teachers started using AI for grading papers, there have been debates on its ethical implications.

Some people say that if students spend time writing an essay, teachers should put in the effort to read them. Even though this seems logical at first glance it overlooks the fundamental difference between writing and grading essays that is key to judging the ethical implications.

Writing an essay is an intellectual exercise for students, intended to develop their critical thinking and writing skills. Its importance lies in the process of writing, not the essay itself. That's why the students must invest time and effort, as this is how they grow intellectually.

On the other hand, the primary goal of grading is to provide objective and detailed feedback. How this feedback is generated is not important. What is important is that the students receive accurate, constructive feedback that guides them on how to improve their English language skills.

Therefore, there's no ethical dilemma in using AI for grading. The use of AI ensures that each student receives proper feedback, a goal that is challenging to achieve without AI.

In fact, there is actually an ethical concern in teachers not using AI for grading. This is obvious if you consider the trend of AI-generated essays that students spend minimal effort on writing yet the teachers have to spend hours on grading.

Using AI in this scenario allows teachers to protect their time and effort from having to read papers and write feedback that the particular students are not even reading or taking into consideration.

Therefore, the ethical question is more about students using AI for essay writing, while expecting teachers to grade them manually. Using AI by teachers for grading on the other hand aligns well with the educational goals of delivering thorough and unbiased feedback.

## AI As The Pillar Of Effective Grading

In conclusion, ELA teachers face a significant challenge in providing detailed, timely feedback on student essays while managing their ever-increasing workloads and maintaining work-life balance.

The AI essay grading gives a promising solution to this problem by providing accurate, unbiased feedback, and allowing teachers to reduce the risk of burnout.

With tools such as ChatGPT and grading platforms like Elagrade.com, teachers can choose between individual or efficient bulk grading.

While some people raise ethical concerns about the use of AI in grading, it is clear that only AI allows teachers to accomplish the primary objective of grading - providing timely constructive feedback to all students.

Therefore it is increasingly important for teachers to leverage this technology to preserve the integrity and efficiency of the feedback they provide.
