**The short answer is no, the long answer is yes.**

Have you tried grading papers with ChatGPT or Google Gemini? Both have free plans with unlimited quota.

They're simple to use, you register in a few clicks, paste the text, and give the instructions for grading it.

And if it gets something wrong you can guide it in the right direction until it gives you an acceptable response.

Since these tools are free, every teacher can use them. We've made a step-by-step guide showing [***how to grade papers with ChatGPT here***](https://elagrade.com/blog/how-to-grade-essays-with-chatgpt)***.***

But, there is a problem with this grading method. The problem that not many teachers know about.

In fact, this problem is not generally known to people outside of the AI engineering world, because it's not officially accepted. The problem is that the AI is getting more stupid; the free models in particular.

### Why was ChatGPT so good?

When ChatGPT just rolled out at the end of 2022, it could do a lot of things. The model had exceptional attention to detail and a high ratio of meaningful answers.

Later introduced the premium GPT4 version was even better. It was so smart that it gave the impression that you were talking to a real person.

This was so by design.

The producer company OpenAI aimed to create a wow effect which would save it from the need to promote their product as the promotion would happen organically via word of mouth.

And they were right in making this bet.

Very soon [chat.openai.com](https://chat.openai.com) grew to over 1 billion visits and billions of dollars in sales a month without OpenAI having to spend a dime on promotion.

### The new promise from OpenAI

After securing a huge user base and making their model a name, OpenAI pursued another clever strategy. They promised their users to make models faster and prices for the API (programmatic access) lower.

A great promise isn't it? Better service, cheaper. Sounds too good to be true.

And as experience shows, things that sound too good to be true usually are too good to be true. And so it was here.

It turned out that these benefits are going to happen at the expense of the service quality.

But here's the catch.

The company hasn't publicly accepted that shift. In fact this is one of the most ignored topics on the forum. Nor did they change the names of the models, or lowered the price to now much less capable premium model for the general public.

In other words, people still pay 20$ / month for a 'premium' model that is comparable to the one they were getting for free initially.

Profit.

Yet, this truth is not publicly accepted. That's why it humbly takes it's place somewhere inbetween the annunaki and the golden billion conspiracy theories.

And the only way to uncover the speculation is to compare the statistics of the old results from the past with the new ones. Something the developers have done. Here is a thread on the OpenAI forum where [***tens of developers complain about the models getting stupider***](https://community.openai.com/t/why-chatgpt-4-0-is-getting-stupider-and-stupider/590741) with time.

### Grading papers with ChatGPT now takes more skill

Now, you probably see where I'm getting at. With the models becoming stupider, receiving satisfactory results is starting to take more time and skill.

In fact, it's now almost impossible to get a decent reply from the first go with a long prompt.

You have to craft the prompt carefully and use the GPT4o model (premium) to have a chance that it duly fulfills all of the requirements.

Crafting the prompt means choosing proper words in the right order. This is known as prompt engineering.

It was not that critical in the early days when the model was smart, but it became more important as time went by. Just like happens with humans, the lower is the intelligence of the person you're talking to, the more carefully you have to choose your words.

Prompt engineering is a fun activity for people who love thinking, as it makes you pay attention to the meaning of the words and their location in the sentence.

But sadly, it's hard.

Therefore, if you intend to grade a paper with over 1k words with ChatGPT, your best bet would be to subscribe to their premium plan, which costs 20$ a month because the free model is not capable of grasping all of the context from this long text to provide a meaningful reply without leaving much of the context out.

It also means that you'll have to get better at communicating your instructions to the AI.

### How bad is the free ChatGPT model for marking papers?

But how bad is it?

Because 20$ is good money in the current economy, and the premium model has a limited quota of 50 messages every 3 hours, why not just use the free version even if it's worse, but give it a ton more follow up instructions?

That's how most teachers who start grading essays with AI think, and it kind of makes sense, if not one detail.

The detail is that the amount of time you have to spend on reading and writing the additional instructions is significant.

And so, instead of saving time and effort on having to read the student's work, you end up wasting it on reading AI's replies, writing additional instructions, and then still having to skim the paper to ensure that the AI grasped everything correctly and you won't end up in an embarrassing situation.

Time this and multiply by your hourly wage and you'll get how much you're losing.

That's why using a free AI model is not a good option unless you're very new to it and just want to see how it feels.

Therefore, if you're planning to get real value out of the AI essay grading a better choice would be to go with the premium version.

The amount of effort-and-time-dollars this will save you will outweigh the 20$ subscription fee pretty quickly.

Or you can also choose a better and cheaper solution, I'm going to reveal in a moment (Who would have thought?).

### So what is the best option for grading papers with AI?

By now we have learned that ChatGPT has become significantly less capable over time.

Consequently, using it's free version for grading homework is not a good idea because of the significant loss of time and effort on giving additional instructions, and a better option would be using a premium model that costs 20$ / month.

But there's one more alternative that is best in my opinion - using specialized AI essay graders.

For obvious reasons, I'll be talking about Elagrade here, but you can probably extend the same arguments to other software too.

As I've already mentioned, getting good results with ChatGPT in one go is hard because the model usually doesn't read everything you give it.

It reads selectively, especially when the text is long which means that you have to become good at writing your prompt in such a way that it retains its meaning even if it's not read entirely.

One of the techniques for achieving this is duplicating the most important parts of your prompt. And there are others.

But still, overall, getting good results with one-shot grading is difficult and unpredictable, and therefore, a better option would ne to ask follow-up questions.

When you ask the follow-up questions, the AI isolates the most relevant parts of the text, and reads them more thoroughly with the aim of finding the answer to your question.

This means that the AI is not skimming as much as it does in the initial run when it has a much longer text and a much less specific task.

The AI is searching and therefore paying much more attention, just like we, humans do.

Yet as we've already discussed, asking follow-up questions takes time and effort, which can negate the time saving benefit you're getting from using the AI.

The good news however, is that asking follow-up questions can be automated.

And this is what Elagrade does for you.

With Elagrade, not only do you get the advantage of a polished initial prompt, but you also can specify a set of follow-up questions that the model will use to check itself before providing you with the final assessment.

All of this is in addition to other benefits such as the free renewable monthly quota, not having to retype your rubric, prepaid pricing, consistent grades over multiple runs, bulk grading of up to 100 papers at a time, and the results available as a single Word document report.

You can read more about how to use Elagrade for grading essays in this article called [***how accurate and reliable is an AI paper grader***](https://elagrade.com/blog/how-accurate-and-reliable-is-an-ai-paper-grader).

### Specialized essay graders are best, premium LLMs are next, and the free bots are for sadomasochists

In conclusion, it's possible to grade essays using ChatGPT for free, but you pay with your time and effort, which you can approximately quantify by multiplying the time you've spent on guiding the model with your hourly wage.

Therefore, it's better to use the premium version of the AI as it's much more capable than the free model.

That said, you will still have to guide it, albeit less, and copy-paste the output, dealing with inconsistent formatting, and risking mixing up the results.

So, instead, you might want to check out specialized grading software such as Elagrade, which lets you automate the follow-up process, grade assignments in bulk, and get the result as a single Word document report, which reduces the grading time of the whole class to several minutes.

Elagrade gives you 20 pages (10k words) free each month. And if you want more, you ***don't*** have to buy a subscription.

So try out both of the ways and choose what's better for you.

Happy grading.
