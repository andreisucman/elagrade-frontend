The AI graders, designed to assist educators with essay grading, are becoming increasingly popular among the ELA teachers. 

After the initial hesitancy due to the common fear of AI taking over our jobs, more and more people start realizing that AI can not just take a job away, but also help one maintain it. 

This especially applies to the realm of English language teaching, particularly in the low income areas where many of the teachers quit for not being able to maintain a work-life balance due to excessive time consumed by grading, or to be exact - the unpaid grading.

These teacher would not have lost their jobs, and the students would not have lost their teachers were working conditions of the former better and the expectations of the latter smaller. And if AI can solve this problem, how can one question it's effectiveness?

So after realizing the life changing value that an AI essay grading software can bring into a teacher’s life the question that commonly arises is what AI grading software is good and how to choose one?

This is what we’re going to explore in this article.

## What AI Essay Grader Is Good And How To Choose One?

The effectiveness of an AI essay grading software hinges on specific features and functionalities that cater to both the teacher's and students' needs. These can be summarized as follows:

### It is easy to use

An AI Essay Grader must be intuitive and user-friendly, allowing teachers, regardless of their tech-savviness, to navigate and utilize its features effectively. 

It should not require any thinking, because thinking takes effort and people who spend most of their time in the craze and noise of schools are usually quite tired by the time they get to grading. 

Therefore, and AI software must have a simple interface that speaks about itself.

### It supports personal style of grading

Every teacher has their own style of grading. Students remember this style and can often understand if their work has been graded by a different person - a T.A. for instance. 

Therefore, it’s important that the AI grading software can imitate the specific style of grading the teacher wants it to adopt. This includes the ability to grade by specific rubrics, as well as a custom definition of what is good / bad writing according to that specific teacher’s style. 

### It provides individual feedback

Many teachers agree that grading is useless without feedback. After all grading is there to stimulate students to do better, but if the student doesn’t know what they did wrong, what is the point in grading them in the first pace? 

Yet the problem is that giving feedback to tens and hundreds of papers is not easy. Not only it takes time to read all papers, but it takes energy to comprehend it, especially in situations where a student’s writing is convoluted. 

Therefore, not many teachers can do it, and those that can, can rarely do it well. And so if the AI is here to help, this is what it must be able to do on teacher’s behalf - provide personalized feedback. 

This feedback should reflect the strength and weaknesses of individual paper avoiding generic comments like "Needs improvement!" that are not only unhelpful but can also be demotivating.

Ideally, the feedback should include references to the lines of text, so that the teacher can easily check it and support themselves if a student asks for the justification.

Now, is there an AI grader that combines all of the points discussed so far? 

Is there one that is easy to use, supports personal style of grading and provides individual feedback line by line?

Yes there is! (Surprise, surprise).
