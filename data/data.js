    question: "Who Is Elagrade For?",
    answer:
      "Elagrade is for English Language Arts teachers who struggle to provide meaningful personal feedback for their students because of the excessive time it takes to grade writing assignments. It's for teachers who want to stay compliant with their principal and admin's demands regarding the number of writing assignments and feedback without having to do unpaid labor and sacrifice psychological health.",

    question: "What If I Don't Like The Results?",
    answer:
      "Elagrade offers a free plan with 20 pages / month (each 500 words) with no credit card required. If, for whatever reason, you decide not to use Elagrade, you can delete the papers you've uploaded.",

    question: "Why Is The Service So Cheap?",
    answer:
      "We use AI to grade your papers with your personal grading style. Because AI is affordable, we can charge you the cost only, plus some markup to make it meaningful for us. That said, our AI uses GPT4 model, which is not to be confused with the free GPT3 model used in ChatGPT. The model we use is significantly bigger and more intelligent, which you can notice if you compare the results.",

    id: "faq_cant_i_just_use_chatgpt",
    question: "Can't I Just Use ChatGPT?",
    answer:
      "The free version of ChatGPT uses the GPT3 model. Elagrade uses the GPT4 model, which is significantly bigger and more intelligent. That's why, to approximate the results of Elagrade, you would have to use the premium version of ChatGPT (ChatGPT Plus), which costs $20/month as of Jan 2024. In addition, with Elagrade, you can grade multiple papers (say 100) at once and have the results available within a minute in a report, as opposed to ChatGPT, where you'd have to copy and paste the assignments 100 times and then copy and paste the results back 100 times, dealing with inconsistent formatting, and having to provide additional guidance, and wait for the chat to print it. In conclusion, Elagrade let's you grade assignments in bulk and pay only for what you grade. It saves you time from having to copy and paste each assignment and it's result, give the instructions, and wait for each of them for being written. It also eliminates the risk of incorrect copy pasting and let's you keep your assessments organized in your account without cluttering your computer or drive.",
